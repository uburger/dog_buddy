    ```

### Test

* Run all tests
    ```
    npm test
    ```
* Run a check
    ```bash
    npm run lint              # linter only
    npm run test:unit         # unit tests only
    npm run test:integration  # integration tests only
    ```

#### Start test server

The server must be running locally with test configuration for the
integration tests to pass.
```
npm run start:test
```
This starts the server on port `3030` 
that integration tests must not interact with the development server.
